<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://folkevalgt.myrland.io)

In an effort to improve transparancy and to better understand the Norwegian democracy, Folkevalgt provides insight into the Storting, the norwegian parliament. It makes it simple to understand who our parliamentary representatives are, what they do, how they use their mandate and how they cast their votes on behalf of the norwegian population.

Some of the features:

- An overview of the current and past Storting, with the represented parties and representatives
- Profiles of all representatives, incl. their current and past mandates, positions, offices, and their education and work experience
- Full voting record of all Storting representatives
